# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Approach with Keras OCR and a CNN

In this folder, you can find the code to test Keras OCR and a CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) on ancient manuscripts images.

The notebook [Keras-OCR and CNN](./Keras-OCR%20and%20CNN.ipynb) contains the code to test Keras OCR and a CNN on ancient manuscripts images. The CNN is trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of handwritten digits.

The folder [images](./images/) contains ancient manuscripts images from eScriptorium as well as their corresponding XML and JSON files. These files indicate the location of the digits in the images.
